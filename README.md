# Release Notes

The project is part of LFX mentee 2022 (summer)inside the Hyperledger foundation.
Hyperledger mentership project Wiki link: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/SLA+Self-Assessment+with+Hyperledger+Fabric 
 
The Project realized with the help of following steps and implimentation for the service level agreement (SLA) test case:

1. Hyperledger Fabric network implimentation.
2. Hypereldger Blockchain explorer https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-explorer
3. Hyperledgre Fabric Private chaincode implimenation inconjuction with fabric smart client.

SLA test case implimentation video-demo is attached and can be found inside the following link: https://github.com/singhravipratap/SLA/blob/a2a62d57f7f9d84f925636677a906323ec61bfda/video/link

# Quick start guide
 In SLA test case tutorial, two organziation in the fabic network (fabric smart client), participate with Fabric private chainecode (FPC) implimentation.

 The user role can be diffent either a developer or/and administrator in both two organziation. To impliment the SLA test case, following task need to be performed following below mentioned steps:

 1. Set up machine and download samples from repository.
 2. Creation of the network.
 3. Exploring the SLA smartcontract.
 4. Deploy the smartcontract.
 5. Using client terminal to interact with the network and perform transaction.

Note: This tutorial has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

## Prerequisites:

You are expected to download the sample Hyperledger Fabric from the Github and install prerequisite files as instructed in the following pages: 
1. Hyperledger Fabric:    https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.3/install.html
2. Hyperledger Fabric Private chaincode:   https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-private-chaincode/tree/go-support-preview 

## Start Hyperledger Fabric Private Chaincode network

## Notes: To be careful while deploying setup
Use specific version of tool as mentioned in the documentaion (for easyness).

## Prerequisites for Fabric Private chaincode implimentation
Ensure that you have correctly installed and setup the $GOPATH and $GOROOT.

# Troubleshooting
### Error in network implimentation in FPC
Please go through the discord channel, few problem has been identified and discussed over there.
